# EXE-xc

EXE-xc is an open-source tool for compiling C source code into executable files. This easy-to-use utility simplifies the process of creating standalone executables from C programs.

## Features

- Compile C source code into executable files.
- User-friendly interface for selecting and compiling C files.
- Progress window to track the compilation process.
- Support for Microsoft's C/C++ compiler (cl).
- Basic text editing features (Cut, Copy, Paste).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use EXE-xc, you need:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (3.11 or higher)
- [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) (typically included with Python)
- A C or C++ compiler (e.g., [Microsoft Visual C++](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Make sure you have Python and tkinter installed on your system.
3. Launch the application by running ```py -m main.py```.

### Usage

1. Click the "Browse" button to select a C file or provide the file path.
2. Click the "Compile / .EXE" button to compile the selected C file.
3. A progress window will appear to track the compilation process.
4. Once the compilation is complete, the resulting executable will be in the same directory as your C file.
